# Contact Print

Is for making contact prints. You know, like you used to do in the dark room.

Requires:

  - _exif_ - command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG files

  - _imagemagick_ - image manipulation programs


Generates static HTML (with help from isotope + jquery)

> $ ./contact_print 
> usage: ./contact_print <dir>
> 
> Make a contact print (html).
> Requires exif and imagemagick.

Ok.
